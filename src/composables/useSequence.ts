// Keeps a sequence going: a spoken slideshow (presentSlide) or a storyboard
// (defineStoryboard, then presentPanel). The model shows the steps one at a
// time and is told, with each, to talk about it and call the next one in the
// same reply. It sometimes ends the reply without doing that, so when a reply
// is over, nothing is playing or running and steps are left, the host asks it
// once to go on.
//
// A step that waits for the user (a how-to step they are doing, a story
// choice) is not asked about: the model goes on when the user says so.
//
// Asked once per step: a model that still doesn't go on has a reason (it is
// answering something else), and asking again would loop. The user speaking
// ends the tracking: they may have said "stop", and if they said "go on", the
// next step starts it again. Speech can be noticed late (Gemini's transcript
// of it arrives seconds after), so the request itself also defers to the user.
