// presentSlide: one slide of a spoken slideshow, a generated picture per
// slide. The model calls it once per slide, in order, and explains each slide
// when it appears. With the slide number and the total as arguments, the host
// knows where a slideshow is and can ask the model to go on
// (src/composables/useSequence.ts).
//
// A slideshow is a presentation (the default: it goes on by itself) or a
// step-by-step guide (mode "steps": a how-to the user follows along with).
// A step waits for the user to say they're ready, is drawn with the previous
// step's picture as a reference so the object stays the same, and a step
// shown earlier ("go back to step 2") is shown again as it was, not redrawn.
//
// ../host/sequenceHost.ts draws the slide and saves the slideshow
// (artifacts/slideshows/<id>.json); what depends on the user (holding a step,
// showing an earlier one again, dropping a repeated call) is decided here.
// The same as MulmoChat's src/tools/presentSlide.ts, where the drawing runs on
// its server.
