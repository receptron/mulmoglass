// defineStoryboard and presentPanel: a story told in pictures, with
// characters who look the same in every panel.
//
// defineStoryboard draws a reference sheet for each character and shows the
// cast; presentPanel then draws one panel at a time with the sheets of the
// characters in it as reference images, which kept a character's face, hair
// and clothes on Gemini, OpenAI and xAI alike (a description repeated in
// every prompt did not). ../host/sequenceHost.ts draws and saves the
// storyboard (artifacts/storyboards/<id>.json), as MulmoChat's server does. Panels go on like slides (./sequence.ts,
// src/composables/useSequence.ts); a panel with choices waits for the user's
// pick, which is held here, where the user's speech is known.
